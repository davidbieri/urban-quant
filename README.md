Course material for "Quantitative Methods for Urban and Regional Research"

This material has evolved from a first-year graduate course in quantitative methods for urban planning and environmental resource students. Several cohorts of students at the University of Michigan provided helpful feedback and fairly patiently endured excursions in to matrix algebra, occasionally agreeing with me that it was important to derive certain concepts from first principles. James Carpenter, Miles Hamby, Arthur Prokosch and Cheng Wang provided excellent research assistance.

The primary objective of this course is to introduce students to some of the quantitative methods and techniques used in planning practice and research. We will cover computer applications for data analysis, including several computer lab sessions. The emphasis is on using methods in the context of planning, urban policy and regional science research, matching the method to the problem, developing an interactive engagement with data methods, promoting creative and accessible styles of data presentation, and developing a critical literacy of data and methods.
 
This course also introduces students to the fundamentals of more advanced regression techniques, such as instrumental variable estimation via Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and binary choice and limited dependent variable models. Reflecting the growing importance of GIS as a tool for planners, this course provides an introduction to key methods and applications in spatial data analysis, including a cursory overview of spatial statistics.
