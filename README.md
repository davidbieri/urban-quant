Course material for "Quantitative Methods for Urban and Regional Research"

This material has evolved from a first-year graduate course in quantitative methods for urban planning and environmental resource students. Several cohorts of students at the University of Michigan provided helpful feedback and fairly patiently endured excursions in to matrix algebra, occasionally agreeing with me that it was important to derive certain concepts from first principles. James Carpenter, Miles Hamby, Arthur Prokosch and Cheng Wang provided excellent research assistance.
